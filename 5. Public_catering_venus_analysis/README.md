### Overall conclusion on data analysis
* The most popular venues in Moscow are cafes (2343 places or 28.4% of the total) and restaurants (1996 places or 24.2% of the total);
* Restaurants, bars, and pubs have the most seating capacity;
* There are more non-chain venues in Moscow (62% compared to 38%);
* Among chain venues, cafes and restaurants are the most common, which is explained by the popularity of this category. When looking at relative indicators, chain venues are more common among bakeries, pizzerias, and coffee shops;
* Around 10% of venues belong to the top 15 chains, which have 803 locations in Moscow. The most popular among them are Shokoladnitsa, Domino's Pizza, and Dodo Pizza;
* Bars and pubs receive the highest ratings, while fast food venues receive the lowest ratings;
* The Central Administrative District (CAO) is represented by venues with the highest ratings, while the Southeastern Administrative District (SAD) has the lowest ratings;
* One of the largest streets in Moscow, Prospekt Mira, predictably has the largest number of venues;
* Cafes are most often opened on streets with only one venue, and there are 460 such streets;
* The highest average check is in the CAO and ZAO. Taking into account ratings, if you want to open high-quality venues, these districts should be considered. The lowest average check is in the SAD. Taking into account low ratings, there may be a shortage of venues with a balance of quality and price in this district.

### Recommendations for opening a new coffee shop
Despite the high concentration of coffee shops in the center, the most attractive district for opening venues remains the Central Administrative District for several reasons:

* For a coffee shop, high foot traffic is important, which is guaranteed almost anywhere in the Central Administrative District;
* Coffee shops are in demand in business and tourist areas, not residential areas, where family venues are more popular;
* High average check and the cost of a cappuccino provide an opportunity to open a coffee shop with lower prices and attract customers due to this, as well as keep prices at the level of competitors and increase sales margins;
* The two main problems of opening a coffee shop in the Central Administrative District are high competition and the cost of renting premises. It is necessary to compete both with quality (coffee shops with high ratings in Moscow are precisely located in the CAD) and with the number of venues themselves.
